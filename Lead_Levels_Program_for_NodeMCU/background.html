              <h1 class="backgroundtitle"> Why You Should Care About Your Water</h1>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two years, the people of Flint, Michigan were unwittingly drinking water contaminated by lead in poisonous concentrations. The residents had no idea that they were drinking water that could and would eventually lead to several serious medical conditions. They had no way of verifying that the dirty and off-smelling water was safe like the government told them. NYC school water supply has not been tested in 10 years. There are problems being reported in Newark schools with drinking water. With this new innovation in water monitoring, regular testing can take place in both the home (with a faucet extension) and in the municipality's pipes.

        <h1 class="backgroundtitle"> How it Works</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most current lead testing devices are kits that are single use and need to be sent to a lab. Our lead detection system is affordable and accurate, as well as keeping a real time,constant graph of lead levels. This graph can be easily accessed from the Internet by both the public and the government. 
            The carbon paste electrodes (CPE) interact with the Pb2+ ions in an aqueous solution, generating a voltage potential. The NodeMCU circuit measures and prints out the voltage every 30 seconds. This data is sent to Adafruit IO, which is linked to our website.
